# Krupoorva- an AR tutor
A project built for Facebook's AR Hackathon
Krupoorva, the personal AR tutor guides the user to choose among the different physics concepts available. On choosing particular concepts, it helps the user understand the concept with audio and text tutorials. Along with that, the user can see the AR objects in action and interact with them. To make the whole process more fun, we have also added face filters that represent the concept that the user is currently learning. The user can switch to any topic at any point of time simply by tapping on the AR tutor which navigates to the available topics. We have covered the topics in physics that students usually find hard to visualize and understand. We believe that during times like these when the students are stuck at home and can't attend their institutions, AR can help enrich the process of learning and make it more fun ðŸŽ‰
